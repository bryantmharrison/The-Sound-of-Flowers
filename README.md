# Travel Cart
Group Functional Design Project for ME1670 (Introduction to Engineering Design in SolidWorks) in the Spring of 2023

## Project Ideation
After brainstorming, I and my group of classmates (Nishu Ankere, Jackson Foster, J.B. Oâ€™Neal, Yash Parmar) decided on a project streamlining the cleaning process on airplanes and other similar mass transport. We settled on a typical catering cart with modifications that allow automation to ease the work of flight attendents. This product is to be designed and drawn in **SolidWorks**.

The cart will contain:
1. An extending trash can designed by Y.P. that extends for ease of reach for flyers
2. A multi-purpose robotic arm designed by N.A. that can rotate and extend to hand flyers any food items requested and able to hold disinfectant spray for cleaning purposes
3. A built-in shop vac designed by me to ease with cleaning the plane
4. Multiple hinged beverage drawers and a frame designed in tandem by J.B.O and J.F.

We then met as a group and established a project timeline with weekly meetings and deadlines for certain parts of the project like models and drawings over the entire semester. I took meeting minutes for each meeting including topic discussions and attendance.
