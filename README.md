# Travel Cart
Group Functional Design Project for ME1670 (Introduction to Engineering Design in SolidWorks) in the Spring of 2023

## Project Ideation
After brainstorming, I and my group of classmates (Nishu Ankere, Jackson Foster, J.B. Oâ€™Neal, Yash Parmar) decided on a project streamlining the cleaning process on airplanes and other similar mass transport. We settled on a typical catering cart with modifications that allow automation to ease the work of flight attendents. This product is to be designed and drawn in **SolidWorks**.

The cart will contain:
1. An extending trash can designed by Y.P. that extends for ease of reach for flyers
2. A multi-purpose robotic arm designed by N.A. that can rotate and extend to hand flyers any food items requested and able to hold disinfectant spray for cleaning purposes
3. A built-in shop vac designed by me to ease with cleaning the plane
4. Multiple hinged beverage drawers and a frame designed in tandem by J.B.O. and J.F.

We then met as a group and established a project timeline with weekly meetings and deadlines for certain parts of the project like models and drawings over the entire semester. I took meeting minutes for each meeting including topic discussions and attendance.

## Preliminary Design
First, we separately began hand drawings of our parts. As such, I began drawing the shop vac and its parts.

Then, upon the next group meeting, we collectively worked on the assembly drawing. This was primarily constructed by J.B.O.

## Detail Design
Now, using the hand drawings, each member began to model the subassemblies in SolidWorks. As such, I modeled the shop vac and its parts.

This included an exploded model view:

Note that there were changes from the hand drawings to the models. This is because details were added not present in the drawings and design changes were necessary for modeling and assembly.

## Manufacturing Working Drawings
After producing the models, we began to turn them into digital drawings. As such, I drew the shop vac and its parts.
